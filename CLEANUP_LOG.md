# Scintilla Codebase Cleanup Log

## Date: June 2025

## Summary
Major cleanup of the Scintilla codebase to remove unused code, consolidate architecture, and improve maintainability. This cleanup followed the successful implementation of citation extraction fixes for Jira queries and tool schema handling improvements.

## Code Removed

### Agent Files (150KB+ removed)
- `src/agents/langchain_mcp.py` (2,468 lines) - Old unused agent implementation
- `src/agents/mcp_client.py` (593 lines) - Unused MCP client 
- `src/agents/mcp_loader.py` (250 lines) - Unused loader
- `src/agents/mcp_utils.py` (59 lines) - Unused utilities

**Total: 3,370 lines of unused code removed**

### Test Files
- `tests/test_credential_system.py` - Referenced deleted modules
- `tests/test_real_hive_servers.py` - Referenced deleted modules

### Script Files  
- `scripts/debug_mcp.py` - Referenced deleted langchain_mcp module

### Other Cleanup
- Removed 35 Python bytecode (.pyc) files from source directories
- Added log files to .gitignore

## Architecture Improvements

### Before
The codebase had multiple competing agent implementations:
- `langchain_mcp.py` (OLD, unused but still present)
- `mcp_client.py` (direct implementation, unused)
- `fast_agent.py` (current implementation)

This caused confusion about which code path was actually being used.

### After
Clean, focused architecture with one clear path:
- `query_handlers.py` → `FastMCPAgent` (entry point)
- `fast_agent.py` → Agent logic with LangChain
- `fast_mcp.py` → MCP tool management with database caching  
- `citations.py` → Extract sources from tool results

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Removed references to deleted modules
- Updated architecture description to reflect single agent system
- Clarified file descriptions in project structure

### Scripts
- Updated `diagnose_tools.py` to remove checks for deleted modules

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: No more confusion about which agent implementation is being used
2. **Maintainability**: Less code to maintain and understand
3. **Performance**: Removed potential for accidentally using slower code paths
4. **Size**: Reduced codebase size by 150KB+ (3,370 lines)

## What Remains

The streamlined codebase now consists of:
- `FastMCPAgent`: High-performance agent with proper tool schema handling
- `FastMCPToolManager`: Database-cached tool management
- `CitationManager`: Multi-source citation extraction (fixed for Jira)

All functionality is preserved while the codebase is much cleaner and easier to understand.
