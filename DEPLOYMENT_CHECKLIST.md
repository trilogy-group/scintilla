## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Step 1: Validate Configuration
- [ ] Run deployment script with dry-run:
  ```bash
  ./infra/deploy.sh -e production --dry-run
  ```
- [ ] Review Terraform plan output
- [ ] Verify estimated costs are acceptable
- [ ] Confirm all resources will be created correctly

### Step 2: Execute Deployment
- [ ] Run full deployment:
  ```bash
  ./infra/deploy.sh -e production
  ```
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress
- [ ] Note any warnings or errors
- [ ] Save Terraform outputs for reference

### Step 3: Verify Infrastructure
- [ ] Check Terraform outputs:
  ```bash
  cd infra/terraform
  terraform output
  ```
- [ ] Note down:
  - [ ] Load balancer DNS name
  - [ ] Database endpoint
  - [ ] Application URL
  - [ ] KMS key ID

## ‚öôÔ∏è Post-Deployment Configuration

### Application Configuration
- [ ] Connect to EC2 instance via SSH (if key pair configured)
- [ ] Configure environment variables in `/opt/scintilla/app/.env`:
  - [ ] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key
  - [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key
  - [ ] `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
  - [ ] `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret
  - [ ] Additional API keys as needed
- [ ] Restart Scintilla service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart scintilla
  ```

### Health Verification
- [ ] Check application health endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl http://your-load-balancer-dns/health
  ```
- [ ] Verify application is accessible via load balancer
- [ ] Check service status on EC2 instances:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status scintilla
  ```
- [ ] Review application logs:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u scintilla -f
  ```

### Database Verification
- [ ] Verify database connectivity from application
- [ ] Check database migrations are applied
- [ ] Verify backup configuration is active
- [ ] Test database performance

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### CloudWatch Configuration
- [ ] Verify log groups are created:
  - [ ] `/aws/scintilla/application`
  - [ ] `/aws/scintilla/access`
- [ ] Check CloudWatch agent is running on EC2 instances
- [ ] Verify metrics are being collected
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch alarms for:
  - [ ] High error rates
  - [ ] High response times
  - [ ] Database connection issues
  - [ ] High CPU/memory usage

### Log Monitoring
- [ ] Application logs are being collected
- [ ] Access logs are being collected
- [ ] Log retention policies are set correctly
- [ ] Log analysis tools configured (if needed)

## üîí Security Verification

### Network Security
